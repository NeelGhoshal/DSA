//An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences b/w consecutive integers are equal.
//For example, [9,10], [3,3,3] and [9,7,5,3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1,3,3,7], [2,1,2] and [1,2,4] aren't arithmetic arrays.
//You have an array of N non-negative integers. the i-th integer of the array is A. You want to choose a contigous arithmetic subarray that has the maximum length
//from the array. Determine the length of the longest contigous arithmetic subarray

//Input: The first line of the input gives the nuber of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line contains N integers.
//The i-th integer is A.

//Output: For each test case, output one line containing Case #x:y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the length of the contigous arithmetic subarray.

//Constraints:
//Time limit:20 seconds per test set
//Memory limit: 1GB
//0<T<100
//0<A<100000000

//Test Set 1
//1<n<2000

//Test Set 2
//1<N<200000 for at most 10 test cases

//For the remaining cases, 2<N<2000
